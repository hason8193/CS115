HW01:
Apply the available plot functions in the guide file and explore other plotting methods to investigate and analyze the "penguins" dataset. Learn how to split the dataset into a training set and a test set (hint: using the train_test_split function from sklearn). Use the training set to train a Decision Tree model and the test set to evaluate the accuracy of the Decision Tree model (hint: using the accuracy_score function from sklearn).
The random_state parameter when using the train_test_split function must be set to your student ID. The random_state parameter when using the decision tree should be fixed at 42.
Try different settings for the max_depth hyperparameter and comment on how this hyperparameter affects the accuracy of the model on the test set. (Write your comments directly in the ipynb file as comments).
